Particle system framework implemented in C#. 

- Needs only standard library C# (with exception of GRNG, which is on my repository as well)
- Particle systems can be loaded directly from XML paramater files.
- Uses GRNG random class for non-uniform random number generation.
- XNAEmitter Wrapper class included under Test Suite for XNA 4.0 support.
- Basic XNA test suite and a few sample XML particle parameter files for experimenting.

TODO: 
- Add advanced parameters:
 location generation by emitter location, global parameters (gravity, wind, etc)
- Support for varying XNA blendmodes.
